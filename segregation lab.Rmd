## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
url <- "https://www.prisonstudies.org/highest-to-lowest/prison-population-total?field_region_taxonomy_tid=All"
prisonData <- as.data.frame(read_html(url) %>% html_table())
```
